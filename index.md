# On-Device Farmer Advisory with Qwen-2.5

**A reproducible, deployable pipeline for running a farmer-advisory LLM on edge devices.**

This repository documents the complete engineering workflow: dataset cleaning, LoRA fine-tuning, model merging, TFLite conversion, LiteRT-LM packaging, benchmarking, key lessons learned, and deployment artifacts.

This work builds upon and extends:
